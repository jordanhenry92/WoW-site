                    <h4>Onward to Uldir - Manbearcow and Officer Team 07/11/2018</h4>
                    <p>
                    Here we are again. A brand new tier before us. We have once again exceeded our own expectations and achieved CE, top 50 overall Illidan and top 9 in the 2 day guild bracket. The success we have experienced and the ongoing momentum we’re experiencing is purely the result of your collective continued dedication. I could spend hours explaining individually how each and every one of you have contributed and come through for this guild and allowed us to achieve what we have. It seemed impossible, perhaps hopeless at times, but so many of you showed up night after night, pull after pull, and it paid off. We're a CE guild and only getting stronger.<br><br>

                    Watery has been doing an amazing job making sure we have the best talent available for our push into Uldir. Potato has been organizing and preparing strategies with the help of dedicated raiders to make sure that we not only maintain our momentum coming out of Argus but continue to improve. Along with these efforts each officer is striving to make this guild the best possible 6-hour guild we can be going forward.<br><br>

                    In order to encourage the best possible results in the upcoming tiers we will be making some adjustments to our overall ranking system. The officer team has put a lot of thought and discussion into what we collectively feel the best path forward for the guild should be in terms of how ranks and promotions will be managed. With this in mind, I would like to introduce you to the core concepts and ideas behind the changes in the weeks to come.<br><br>

                    Firstly, we will be re-categorizing not just what it means, but also what it takes, to become a Champion, Raider, Alternate Raider, or Casual member of the team. Each of these ranks will be determined based on: Attendance, Preparedness, Attitude, Performance, and Guild Legacy. To take directly from the document:(edited)<br><br>

                    “The following criteria will be used to assign each raider to the appropriate rank based on their performance over recent raids. The ranks will be used to determine who to invite for all scheduled guild runs. In general, every raider from every rank may be asked to sit occasionally to rotate through all of the raiders in good standing and also allow trials to demonstrate their value. Champions have demonstrated that they are pillars of the raid and will not typically be asked to sit unless there are unusual or extreme circumstances.”<br><br>

                    For each aforementioned rank, specific requirements have been defined in a document we will be sharing amongst all members and prospective members. While it may seem more formal, please trust that a lot of thought and consideration has gone into this new structure. I have worked personally to ensure that while we become more efficient and structured, we also maintain the environment and culture that has kept our raids successful, and our attitudes positive. Our primary objective with this initiative is to be transparent with the expectations of each member of the raid team and to incentivise and reward raiders who are going out of their way to exceed those expectations.<br><br>

                    In order to help introduce the new standards and start fresh, all raiders and core raiders will be moved to the standard Raider rank prior to moving into Uldir. The goal here is to provide each raider with a clear understanding of what is expected of them both inside and prior to raids as well as acknowledgement for those individuals who go above and beyond while adding as much transparency as possible to the process of constructing the raid roster throughout the night. For people who currently go above and beyond we understand it may feel bad to get demoted or to think that your contributions were not recognised. On the contrary, part of our goals are to more clearly recognise those individuals moving forward and we have no doubts that the people who continue to exceed expectations will quickly earn their appropriate status.<br><br>

                    A lot of thought and careful consideration has gone into drafting the new standards and the decision to soft reset the ranks. While we recognize there may be some of you that deem this unfair or unwarranted, please understand this is a necessary step in order to provide a frictionless transition to our new ranking model, and to ultimately become a better guild. Posted below, you can view the documents for rank guidelines, and we will be posting them on the website as well for added transparency. With your help and continued dedication we will become an even better meme dream team. Our spot as a top five 2-day guild on Illidan is just ahead of us, so let's keep up the focus and have our best tier yet. As always, if you have any questions or concerns about the changes to rank, or our decision making process in general I encourage you to reach out to myself or another officer directly.
